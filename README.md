# Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict car prices based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant factors. Using machine learning techniques, the model analyzes historical data to provide accurate price estimates for used cars.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering to enhance prediction accuracy
- Implementation of regression models for price prediction
- Evaluation metrics to measure model performance
- User interface built with Gradio for easy interaction

## How to Use
1. Load the dataset containing car information.
2. Preprocess the data to handle missing values and outliers.
3. Train the regression model on the cleaned data.
4. Use the trained model to predict car prices for new inputs via the Gradio interface.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Gradio
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
